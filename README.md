## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Local Development Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/10xcards.git
   cd 10xcards
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` - Starts the development server
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run watch` - Builds the app in watch mode for development
- `npm test` - Runs the test suite
- `npm run lint` - Runs the linter
- `npm run serve:ssr:app` - Serves the server-side rendered application

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Cloudflare Pages. Deployment is automated via GitHub Actions.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in Cloudflare Pages:

- `supabaseUrl` - URL to your Supabase instance
- `supabaseKey` - API key for your Supabase instance
- `openRouterKey` - API key for OpenRouter

Optional variables for E2E tests:
- `E2E_USERNAME` - Username for E2E tests
- `E2E_PASSWORD` - Password for E2E tests
- `E2E_USERNAME_ID` - User ID for E2E tests

**IMPORTANT**: These variables contain sensitive information and should never be committed to the repository. They should be set in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard under Settings > Environment variables.

### Deployment Process
